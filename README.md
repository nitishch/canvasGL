canvasGL
========

`This repository was started on 10th October 2014`

Aim of this repository is to implement basic graphics algorithms like Bresenham, Scanfill etc.. using [canvas](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-canvas-element) tag introduced in HTML5. Presently there is nothing in this repository except this awesome README file. 

###Demo

###Issues

1. When we go near to the pixel level, grid takes the entire space leaving less for the canvas.
2. This website is not responsive.
3. In Chrome grid changes immediately after the slider is moved. But Firefox waits for the mouse to be released. This seems to be an intended behavior in Firefox. [Bug Report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853670)
4. UI is too bad. Presently it just works.
