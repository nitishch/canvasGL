canvasGL
========

`This repository was started on 10th October 2014`

Aim of this repository is to implement basic graphics algorithms like Bresenham, Scanfill etc.. using [canvas](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-canvas-element) tag introduced in HTML5. Presently there is nothing in this repository except this awesome README file. 


###Issues

1. When we go near to the pixel level, grid takes the entire space leaving less for the canvas.
2. This website is not responsive.
